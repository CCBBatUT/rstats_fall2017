This week we will be talking about how to run R on the TACC high performance computing clusters. All of the files from the presentation can be found [here](https://github.com/CCBBatUT/rstats_fall2016/raw/gh-pages/files/9_tacc_r.zip). If you are interested in trying to get it up and running on your own TACC account, it might be easier to start by cloning a github respository, which can be found [here](https://github.com/sjfox/9_tacc_r).
