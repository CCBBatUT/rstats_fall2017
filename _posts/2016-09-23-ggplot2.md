#### Tidying data for ggplot

   - ggplot uses data in tidy format
   - In tidy data, each row is one observations
   - Columns are characteristics of that observation
   - Tidy data manifesto https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html
   - Most datasets do not arrive in a tidy form, so they must be tidied


#### Intro to ggplot
 
   - ggplot is a graphical grammar for making plots
   - It has a common syntax for many different types of plots (geoms)
