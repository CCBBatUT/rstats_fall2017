This week we will be discussing probability and likelihood in R. The in class materials can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/CCBBatUT/rstats_fall2016/raw/gh-pages/files/6_likelihood.zip).

## Topics Covered
1. Probability distributions in R
    - Probability distribution commands
    - Generating samples from probability distributions
1. Calculating Likelihoods
    - Calculating likelihoods for linear models
    - Finding the MLE
1. Interpreting Likelihood results
    - Generating random data samples
    - Fitting models to random data
    - Testing MLE limits of `lm()` function in R
