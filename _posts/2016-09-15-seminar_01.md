For our first week of the Rstats seminar we will be delving into data visualizations in R using ggplot2. The session will cover ggplot2 syntax and provide a variety of different examples for customizing your own plots. As supplementary material take a look at the [data visualization chapter in R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html).
