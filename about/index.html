            This is the official website for the Fall 2016 Peer-led Data Analysis in R at UT Austin, offered through the <a href="http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/">Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics</a>. The goal of this class is to provide the practical statistical and programmatic experience for running data analyses on scientific data using <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>.

    		The class will meet on Fridays from 2-3 pm in FNT 1.104, with 30 minutes after class for optional extended exercises. In addition, feel free to join us for Open Coding Hour at Wednesdays 4-5pm in CCBB conference room (MBB Library/Lounge -- MBB 2nd floor classroom with glass tile walls) for any extra help or feedback.
